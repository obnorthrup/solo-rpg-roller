About
-----

This workflow implements the simple solo rpg system [featured on the Tiny Solitary Soldiers blog](http://tinysolitarysoldiers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/solo-rpg.html).

How to use the script
---------------------

Call `solo-rpg.py` to roll the dice as per the link above and print the results. You can give the script an option argument of `+` or `-` to specify advantage or disadvantage.

How to use the Alfred 2 workflow
--------------------------------

- Type `solo` and hit return to get a notification with the results.
- Type `solo+` if your hero has an advantage, or `solo-` if they're disadvantaged. See the link above to see what that means.
- Hold down `option` when you hit return to paste the results, rather than displaying them.

The `Solo RPG roller` directory is just the workflow unpacked, in case you want to peek. (You can also just change the extension of the `.workflow` file to `.zip` and get at it that way.)
